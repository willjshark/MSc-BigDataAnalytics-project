Final project for my MSC Big Data Analytics Module: Wrangling a Large Timeseries Dataset on COVID-19 Cases in the Philippines

This project involved handling and analysing a substantial dataset containing timeseries data on COVID-19 cases. 
I applied various data wrangling techniques to clean and preprocess the data, followed by exploratory data analysis to uncover valuable insights and trends. 
The goal was to identify patterns and correlations that could inform public health decisions.
